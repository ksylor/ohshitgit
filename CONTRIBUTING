# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Oh, Shit, Git! 

Note that I will only accept PRs for language translations (e.g. translating the site into a new language) or fixes to typos. 

If you have ideas for new content or thoughts on how to improve existing content, please open an Issue first so that we can discuss it. 

This site is my copyrighted content and my decisions whether or not to make any suggested changes are final. 

## Pull Request Process for Language Translations

1. Once your PR is submitted, Netlify will auto-generate a deploy preview where you can confirm your changes, please make sure that everything is in order for both the swears and noswears versions.
2. I will review the PR and confirm that everything is in order in the deploy preview, and request any changes if necessary.
3. I will merge in the PR once all comments and changes are addressed.
